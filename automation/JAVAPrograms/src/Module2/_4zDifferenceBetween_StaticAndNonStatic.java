	/*		STATIC											NON static										
	1 static mean single copy							- multiple copies
	2 static members are present in SPA					- object
	3 static members can access in 3ways				- access through object
	4 static members will get loaded only once in SAP	- Whenever we crate an object
	5 class loader is responsible to load static member - new keyword is responsible,,
	6 any changes made to static variable will effect
	  Entire class that is why static variable also 
	  called as Class variable							- effect for particular Object thats why 
	  														it is Called Instance variable
	7 we go for static if data is fixed					- if data is changing
	  ex:- static String College = "MRIET"					ex:- static String course = "ECE"
	
	8 static methods can't inheritance & overloaded		- can inheritance & overloaded.
