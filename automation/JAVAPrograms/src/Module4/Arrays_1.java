/*->Array is defined as an "Object" Which Stores "group of Homogenous Value in continous Manner.
  ->Every value in array Object will have an Index position Starting from(0,1,2,3,,,).
  ->Array represented with "square bracket"i.e [].
  ->When creating an Array object we should Compulsory give the Size.
  ->Size must be Numeric Values.
  -> We can Store the Values Only Upto what we give size, if we cross the Size of an Array 
  	 we will get "ARRAY INDEX OUT OF BOUNDs EXCEPTION".
  
  Length variable:-
  ->length is a variable Which returns no.of values Stored in an Array(Size of Array)
  
  ->for using Arrays we need to follow 3 steps
  	1,Array creation. 		-> Arraytype Arrayname[] = new Arraytype[size of array];
  	2,Array initialization	-> 		Arrayname[index] = value;		
  	3,Array utilization		-> 		S.O.P(ArrayName[index]);
